## Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the library! There are many ways to contribute (code, testing, bugs etc.) and we appreciate contributions of all size.

## Code

* Please add an issue for the PR you are working on so that even if the PR cannot be merged the issue can be used for tracking.
* Clone the repo.
* Fix a bug or add a feature.
* Update the docstring if needed.
* Add test cases or update the current ones with respect to the fix.
* Test them locally or using Travis for your account.

## Documentation

* Docs are maintained in the `gh-pages` branch.
* You can edit a docstring and make a PR.

## Code guidelines

* I personally prefer aligned `let` statements and it is possible in Emacs using `C-c SPC` on the let block. It's ok if your tooling doesn't support it.

Thanks again for your time and effort.
